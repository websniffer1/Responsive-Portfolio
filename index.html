      <p>Hi everyone! Ever since I can remember I have always had an interest in solving complex problems
          and fixing things. I first stumbled upon coding in college through a friend who had taught himself 
          how to build websites. I developed an interest in this but was unable to make significant progress in teaching
          myself how to code using online resources. I conducted an online search and found out that GW has a program in
          web development. I did not hesitate in signing up as I felt that this was an opportunity I had to seize.</p>
